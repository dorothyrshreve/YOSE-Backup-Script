# YOSE-Backup-Script
backs up AGOL and Portal data

This script downloads zipped files containing JSONs of all the items from specified groups on AGOL or Portal. 
The zipped files can be extracted with an ArcGIS Toolbox tool.

It will not download attachments, and any Global IDs are saved as text fields instead of GlobalID types.
